-- Migrate notification_subscriptions (System B) rows where channel='webhook'
-- into the webhooks table (System A) as part of the v1.1.9 webhooks v2 work
-- (artifact-keeper#919, #927).
--
-- Idempotency: enforced by a unique partial index on (url, repository_id)
-- created BEFORE the INSERT below. The INSERT uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
-- so re-running this migration is a no-op even under concurrent runs. The
-- prior NOT EXISTS guard was probabilistic; this is a hard constraint.
-- A subscription is treated as already-migrated if a webhooks row exists
-- with the same URL and the same repository_id (or both NULL for
-- global-scoped subscriptions).
--
-- Retention: existing notification_subscriptions rows are NOT deleted by
-- this migration. System B continues to deliver notifications during the
-- v1.1.9 deprecation window so customers do not lose deliveries while
-- they migrate. The actual System B removal lands in v1.2.0
-- (artifact-keeper#920) once the deprecation window closes.
--
-- Secrets: secret_hash is intentionally left NULL. Migrated rows have
-- NEITHER a bcrypt secret_hash NOR a secret_encrypted value. The
-- notification subscription's plaintext config.secret cannot safely be
-- transcribed into either column, so customers must call
-- /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/rotate-secret to mint a fresh signing secret on
-- the migrated row. Webhooks where both forms are NULL still deliver, but
-- the retry path emits NO X-Webhook-Signature header so receivers can
-- distinguish "configured but legacy/unsigned" from "actively signed".
--
-- Event-type mapping: notifications use dot-separated names
-- (artifact.uploaded), webhooks use underscore-separated names
-- (artifact_uploaded). The CASE expression below was historically guarded
-- by a Rust drift-fence test in `notification_dispatcher::tests`. Both
-- the dispatcher and that test were removed in artifact-keeper#920
-- (v1.2.0) when System B notifications were retired. Migration 081 itself
-- still runs on upgrades from any pre-v1.1.9 cluster, but the mapping is
-- effectively frozen now: no future Rust code reads it, and the data it
-- moves into the `webhooks` table is stable. Edit ONLY in lock-step with
-- a manual one-off migration that rewrites the affected `webhooks.events`
-- rows.

-- Idempotency guard: hard uniqueness on (url, repository_id) treating NULL
-- repository_id as a synthetic zero-UUID so the constraint covers both
-- repo-scoped and global-scoped webhooks.
